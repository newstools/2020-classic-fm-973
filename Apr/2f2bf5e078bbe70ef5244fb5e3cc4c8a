The Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) has today announced that the national strategy to Scale up Access to Covid-19 testing in Nigeria is now ready, calling for contributions from the general public.  Director General of NCDC, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu who disclosed this at the Presidential Taskforce Press briefing in Abuja said part of the strategy focus is to restructure disease testing approach and to expand its diagnostics capacity in the health sector in Nigeria amongst others.  Our correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that according to NCDC, 35 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 were recorded in the country Thursday night, raising the total number of infections to 442.  The Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire said the increase in the numbers of new coronavirus cases is due to scaled up implementation of new case finding strategy, as well as the result of rising community transmission. He again advised Nigerians to disclose fully their health details to health workers, come out for voluntary testing when exposed to infected persons and discouraged increasing spate of discrimination against patients with the virus.
