In a bid to continuously engage students during the closure of schools in the Lagos State, the Honourable Commissioner for Education, Mrs. Folasade Adefisayo has announced the introduction of another daily educational radio programme targeted at the Junior Secondary School Students.  A statement issued on Thursday by the Commissioner said the radio teaching programme is an initiative of the Ministry of Education and partnership between the Lagos State Government, Naija FM 102.7 and South Saharan Social Development Organisation. She disclosed that the radio lessons will cover four subjects; English Studies, Mathematics, Basic Science and Civic Education, adding that the teachings are to commence from Monday, 6th of April, 2020, running from noon to 1p.m daily.  Speaking further, Adefisayo averred that the aim of the radio programme is to keep the students engaged while at home during the lockdown period, urging parents and guardians to ensure that their children tune in to Naija FM 102.7 and make the best use of the quality teachings and educative programme. The Commissioner, however, noted that a similar programme initiated for Senior Secondary School Students had commenced on Monday, 30th March, 2020 and is currently ongoing on WAZOBIA radio and television stations between 11a.m to 1p.m as well as 2p.m and 4p.m daily respectively.
