JAY-Z and Rihanna are providing help during the coronavirus pandemic with their foundations. Hov’s Shawn Carter Foundation and RiRi’s Clara Lionel Foundation have teamed up for a $2 million donation to assist COVID-19 relief efforts in New York and Los Angeles.  “In times of crisis, it is imperative that we come together as one community to ensure that everyone, especially the most vulnerable, has access to critical needs: shelter, health, nutrition and education,” Hov’s mother Gloria Carter, who serves as his foundation’s CEO, said in a press release. “The only way to get through this pandemic is with love and action.”  Organizations receiving money from the donations include Mayor’s Fund for L.A., Fund for Public Schools, American Civil Liberties Union and the New York Immigration Coalition. Funds will be used to support the following causes during the pandemic: Last week, the Clara Lionel Foundation announced $5 million in grants to support on-the-ground partners fighting COVID-19 in the United States, Africa and the Caribbean. Rihanna’s organization also donated personal protective equipment to the State of New York.  “There are a number of populations who are especially vulnerable during this pandemic — those who are undocumented, incarcerated, elderly and homeless, as well as children of frontline health workers and first responders,” CLF executive director Justine Lucas said. “Now more than ever, we need to support organizations prioritizing the health and rights of these individuals.”  Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Rihanna and CLF’s annual Diamond Ball has been postponed. The foundation is focusing all of its efforts on COVID-19 relief for the foreseeable future.
