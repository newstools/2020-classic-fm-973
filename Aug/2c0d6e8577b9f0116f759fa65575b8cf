...Urges Citizens to Ignore the Trending Fake News. The Inspector General of Police, IGP Mohammed Adamu, has reassured Nigerians that the statutory entry requirements into Nigeria Police Force remains sacrosanct and would be thoroughly followed in the ongoing Police recruitment screening exercise.  The IGP’s reassurance became necessary following news a report making the rounds in some sections of the media that the IGP has suspended the entry requirement for candidates who applied to join Nigeria Police Force as Police constables in the ongoing recruitment screening exercise.  The IGP, while noting that no one has the powers to alter the conditions for recruitment into the Force – these, having been clearly provided for in Sections 71 – 75 and other relevant sections of the Police Act and Regulations - stated that all candidates who successfully completed the online recruitment registration exercise were invited for physical and credential screening from 24th August 2020 to 6th September 2020 at various venues in States across the Federation and the FCT.  The screening officers have been directed to allow all the applicants to participate in the exercise and to recommend their suitability or otherwise in the spirit of transparency, accountability and fair hearing using the already established benchmarks as contained in the Act.
