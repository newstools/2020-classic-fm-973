The Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission, (RMAFC) has called for more development of the gas infrastructure with a view to harnessing more revenue from the sector to the federation account.  This was made known by the RMAFC Chairman Engr Elias Mbam in a recent release in Abuja noting that the potentials of gas to Revenue generation is enormous and needs to be properly exploited.  According to Mbam, the continuous flaring of gas in the Country is not for the best interest of the Nation. In his view, Nigeria as a Nation is blessed with an abundance of gas deposits measuring more than two trillion cubic tons thereby making it to be the 9th largest country in gas reserves in the world.  The RMAFC Chairman observed that Nigeria has not been able to utilize this. He noted that against the health hazard posed to the oil producing communities in Nigeria due to environmental pollution, flared gas in Nigeria could be converted and channeled to the economy where more than two million people could be employed while being utilized for industrial purposes such as power generation.  Engr. Mbam believes that in line with the current dwindling revenue from oil, gas economy could be a safe haven for the country while projecting that Nigeria could generate more than one billion dollars annually from the sector if only relevant stakeholders could do the needful as stated.
