The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has revealed plans to approach the Supreme court, over conflicting judgements by the Court of Appeal, relating to deregistration of some political parties.  The National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, in a statement on Monday, said INEC is in receipt of the judgement of the Court of Appeal delivered today, August 10, 2020 in an Appeal filed by ACD and 22 others relating to their deregistration by the Commission. In the judgement, the Court of Appeal held that the deregistration of ACD & 22 others is ultra vires the powers of the Commission and ordered the Commission to reinstate them.  He added that, faced with two conflicting judgements from the same Court, the Commission is not in a position to pick and choose which one of them to obey, disclosing that the Commission will approach the Supreme Court for a final resolution of the issues raised in the two conflicting judgements.  Meanwhile, Okoye noted that the Commission is focused on preparations for the conduct of the Edo and Ondo Governorship elections scheduled to hold on September 19, 2020 and October 10, 2020 and is strictly and methodically following its timetable and schedule of activities derived from the Constitution and the Electoral Act. He assured Nigerians and the people of Edo and Ondo States that the Commission is on course and will deliver on its mandate.
