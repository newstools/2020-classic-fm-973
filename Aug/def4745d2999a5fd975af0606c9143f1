And this is a trend likely to continue. Floods have been identified to affect more people and cause more economic losses than any other hazard, (Wisner et al, 2004).  The Minister then urged States to encourage relevant Federal Ministries, Department and Agencies to take necessary actions in support of the process, respectfully requested States to kindly take proactive and necessary mitigative measures in addressing the envisaged 2020 flood disaster even in the midst of COVID 19 pandemic.
