The Presidential Task Force has advised that Nigerians should put off non-essential trips this December to avoid further spread of the Covid-19 virus.  The Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on Covid-19 PTF, Mr Boss Mustapha who said this today during the Presidential Task Force National Briefing noted thatÂ  the PTF is escalating its surveillance and testing drive to ensure that the spread of the virus is effectively contained this festive season.  Our correspondent Nathan Williams reports that the Minister of Health Dr. Osagie Ehanire also emphasized that non-essential travels by mass transit and to countries that have high infection rates should be avoided noting that this could result in more transmission of the virus especially among families.  Meanwhile the Director General NCDC Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu stated that the first stream of NYSC has concluded camping while the 2nd stream will go to camp on 3rd December and the third stream would be in January 2021.
