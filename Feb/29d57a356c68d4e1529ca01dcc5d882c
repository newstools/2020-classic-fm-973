A Woolwich Crown Court in London, is holding an extradition hearing on the case of WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange. If he is extradited to the U.S., the whistleblower could be sentenced up to 175 years prison for publishing classified information about war crimes committed in Iraq and Afghanistan by American troops.  The first part of the hearing is expected to continue this week, while the second one is set for May. Assange was arrested for jumping bail in April 2019, after a seven-year asylum stay at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. The WikiLeaks founder previously announced that he had to jump bail as the authorities planned to hand him over to the United States. He has been accused in the United S of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion in order to assist Chelsea Manning to gain access to privileged information.
