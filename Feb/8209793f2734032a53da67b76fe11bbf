Steven Bergwijn has given Tottenham Hotspur the victory over one-man-down Manchester City in their chase for the top four positions. The 22-year-old's goal came with Spurs' first shot on target after Oleksandr Zinchenko had been dismissed for a second yellow card and City midfielder Ilkay Gundogan had seen a first-half penalty saved by Hugo Lloris.  This victory has pushed Tottenham to 5th on the table; four points away from fourth-placed Chelsea. Man City, on the other hand,  are now 22 points behind league leaders Liverpool who can win the title on 21 March when they play Crystal Palace
