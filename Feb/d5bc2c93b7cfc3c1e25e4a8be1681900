The Nigerian Senate has given Ministries, Departments and Agencies of government a two-week deadline to appear before the Senate Committee on Local and Foreign Debts to defend President Muhammadu Buhari’s $29.96bn foreign loan request pending before the National Assembly.  The call on MDAs to appear before the Panel was made by President of the Senate Ahmad Lawan, following a point of order raised on the floor by the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Clifford Ordia (PDP – Edo Central).  Senator Ordia decried the failure of relevant MDAs to appear before the Committee to justify the proposed allocation of monies for projects under their supervision and captured in President Buhari’s loan request.  Our Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that the Ministries, Departments and Agencies of government yet to appear before the Senate Committee, according to the lawmaker, include: The Federal Ministries of Education, Power, Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Water Resources, Communication and Digital Economy, Health, Humanitarian Affairs, and Agriculture.   President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, in his remarks, urged the relevant MDAs to appear before the Senate Committee on Local and Foreign Debts to provide the necessary information required by the Senate to reach a decision on President Buhari’s loan request before the National Assembly.   Chairman of the Local and Foreign Debts Committee, Senator Ordia, however, pleaded for an extension of the window period to two weeks, a request which was approved by the Senate President.
