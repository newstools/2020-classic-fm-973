Joseph Shabalala, one of the pioneer African musicians to introduce African sound to the world has died. Shabalala died in hospital in Pretoria, South Africa, the band's manager said.  "Yes it's true. Mr Shabalala passed on this morning," Xolani Majozi told the South Africa Times. "The group is on tour in the US, but they have been informed and are devastated because the group is family."  "We celebrate and honour your kind heart and your extraordinary life. Through your music and the millions who you came in contact with, you shall live forever." the band said in a statement.  The 78-year-old was best known as the founder and director of choral group Ladysmith Black Mambazo, which won five Grammy awards and featured heavily on Paul Simon's Graceland album. They also reached number 15 in the UK charts with a cover of Swing Low Sweet Chariot, for the 1995 Rugby World Cup.
