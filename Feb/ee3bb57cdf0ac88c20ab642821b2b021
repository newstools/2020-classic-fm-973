Mexico has returned an ancient bronze sculpture to Nigeria after thwarting an attempt to smuggle it into the country, officials say. Customs officers seized it at the main airport in Mexico City. The artefact is from Nigeria's south-western Ife city, famous for works depicting royalty and deities of the once-powerful Yoruba kingdom.  The sculpture is of a man sitting cross-legged, wearing a head dress and holding an object.  "A beautiful bronze piece, and being of Nigerian heritage, it should return to its home," said Diego Prieto, the head of Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History. The institute verified that the sculpture was of Yoruba origin, and it has been handed to Nigeria's ambassador to Mexico, Aminu Iyaw.
