The Nigerian Senate has urged the state-run oil and gas company the NNPC to re-evaluate the state of the country’s four refineries with a view to ensuring optimal performance to meet the growing demand in the country.  This followed a motion by Taraba Central Senator, Yusuf Abubakar who voiced his concern on the generally poor state of the country’s refineries, a factor that makes Nigeria depend on importation of refined products.  Senator Abubakar brought up this subject as a matter of urgent public importance, with Ogun Central Senator, Ibikunle Amosun sharing his point of view.  Ruling on the motion, Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, said the desire of the Senate to complete work on the Petroleum Industry Bill PIB is also aimed at paying attention to the country’s ailing refineries.  Nigeria’s four refineries are those in Warri commissioned in 1978, Kaduna Refinery commissioned in 1989 as well as the Port Harcourt Refining Company established in 1965 and the New Port Harcourt refinery commissioned in 1989.
