National leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC),Â  Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has called on politicians already planning for the 2023 elections to shun the ideas and concerntrate on nation building.  Asiwaju Tinubu, who spoke to newsmen Tuesday, shortly after a private meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja described the politicians anticipating for 2023 elections as unfocused and restless. He stressed that "the time to talk about zoning in the APC is not now".  Our State House Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that the APC Leader while reacting to President Buhari's alleged third term agenda, said that any reasonable politician, who had worked with President Buhari would know that he will not tamper with the Constitution, adding that distractors are always suspicious and will make unnecessary accusations.
