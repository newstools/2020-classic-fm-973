Following the face-off between the Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, at a session organized by a Joint National Assembly Committee on Tuesday, the National Assembly has ordered the suspension of the Special Public Works programme under the National Directorate of Employment to cushion the effect of COVID-19 pandemic.  Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari, had approved the recruitment of 774, 000 Nigerians across the 774 local government areas of the country to take off in October this year. The spokesperson for the Senate, Senator Ajibola Basiru, who announced the suspension of the programme while briefing Senate Correspondent in Abuja, said the National Assembly has summoned the Minister in charge of the Ministry to appear before the federal legislature, to explain the recruitment modalities.  Speaking earlier on the disagreement, Senator Ifeanyi Ubah described the conduct of the Minister, Mr Festus Keyamo, at the session as a ‘bad display of rascality’, insisting that it was the right of the parliament to be carried along on how employment opportunities are distributed to their constituents.
