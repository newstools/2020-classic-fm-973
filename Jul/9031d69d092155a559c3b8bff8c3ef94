Amidst incessant security challenges in some parts of the country, the Nigerian Senate has again called on service chiefs to step aside as the nation continues to grapple with security challenges so as to give room for better security management.  The federal lawmakers made the call during plenary today as additional resolution following a motion by Senator Ali Ndume who bemoaned the recent ambush of soldiers in Katsina and the alleged voluntary resignation of many soldiers noting that if the trend continues there will be dire consequences for the country.  The demand for the resignation of the Service Chiefs was put forward in a proposed amendment to the resolutions of the Senate moved by Senator Francis Adenigba Fadahunsi (PDP – Osun East); and seconded by Betty Apiafi (PDP – Rivers West).  The Upper Chamber urged Federal Government to urgently intensify the provision of modern equipment, to enhance the operational capacities of the armed forces.  Our Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that the Senate also mandated the joint Committee of the Senate on Army, Air-force, Navy, Interior, National Security and Nigeria Police to receive briefing from Security Chiefs on the state of affairs of the Security agencies.
