The Director General of the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, Mr. Lamido Yuguda has stated that the capital market has a lot of potentials for growth and development of Nigeria post COVID-19 and beyond.  Yuguda who resumed alongside the Executive Commissioners namely: Mr. Reginald Karawusa, Mr. Ibrahim Boyi and Mr. Dayo Obisan in Abuja, on Monday said the capital market is a crucial component of any economy, as the SEC over the last two decades has worked with other relevant stakeholders to introduce and implement various initiatives targeted at improving the regulation and development of the market.
