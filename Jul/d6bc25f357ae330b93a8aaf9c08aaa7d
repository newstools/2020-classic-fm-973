The Presidency says it has noted the resolution by the Senate today (Tuesday) calling on the Service Chiefs to resign or be sacked due to the multi-pronged security challenges in the country.  In a statement signed by Special Adviser to the President, (Media and Publicity), Femi Adeshina the Presidency reiterates that appointment or sack of Service Chiefs is a Presidential prerogative, and President Muhammadu Buhari, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, will do what is in the best interest of the country at all times.
