Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige has Monday tendered an apology to the joint committee of the National Assembly on Labour over last week 774,000 job recruitment face-off noting that the harmonious relationship between the Legislature and the Executive is needed for the development of the country.  Speaking when he met with the leadership of the Senate headed by Senate President Ahmed Lawan in Abuja, the Minister recalled the negative impact of the rancorous relationship between the Legislature and Executive of 8th Senate saying that the suspension of the 774,000 youth recruitment exercise will negatively affect the initiative to ameliorate the suffering of masses who are unemployed.  In his response, Senate President, Ahmed Lawan said the National Assembly is empowered to accept or reject Executive requests hence the approval of the N52billion for the project which is agreed to be implemented by the National Directorate of Employment to be supervised by the Ministry of Labour and Employment.  The Senate President insisted that the programme should only be implemented by the NDE and supervised by the Ministry and all work in progress should be suspended and started afresh. He also asked them to comply with the decisions of the joint committee.  Our Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that Chairman, NASS Joint committee on Labour, Senator Akwashiki Godiya directed that the Ministry and NDE should go back and rework the modalities and report back to the committee on Monday 13th adding that all previous actions should be dissolved.  Addressing journalists after the Interactive session, Minister of State for Labour, Festus Keyamo who expressed his displeasure over the directives by NASS citing constitutional provisions said NASS has no right to hijack programmes to be implemented by the Executive and he would go back to Mr President for further directives.
