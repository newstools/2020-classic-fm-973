...Asks Security Agencies to Enforce Ban on Interstate Travels The Presidential Task Force on Covid-19 has warned states that are contemplating to reopen schools, sports stadiums, viewing centers and other places of larger gatherings, not to do so as it is not yet safe.  Chairman of the task force and Secretary to Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha, who gave the admonition at the daily briefing in Abuja on Monday, appealed to state governments to embark on wider community testing, enforcement of rules on social gatherings, stepping up community engagement and risk communication. PTF Boss also implored security agencies to strictly enforce the ban on inter-state travels.  Our correspondent Nathan Williams reports that the Minister of Aviation Mr. Hadi Sirika, during the Presidential Task Force briefing stated that the Executive Jet Services which was supposed to fly an Appeal Court Judge, Justice Adefope Okogie, from Lagos to Abuja has been suspended indefinitely for conveying Naira Marley adding that the Captain will also be punished for providing misleading information.  The Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, however expressed fears that the ongoing strike action by the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) may lead to loss of lives, as this is a very trying time with the COVID-19 pandemic and urged the resident doctors to show empathy by calling off the strike assuring them that their sundry requests are being attended to.
