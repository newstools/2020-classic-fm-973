The Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) has resolved to proceed on an indefinite nationwide strike action after the expiration of a 14-day ultimatum issued on 30th of May.  The President of the Association, Dr Aliyu Sokomba who made the disclosure while addressing the journalist in Abuja, today said the Associationâ€™s decision is predicated on the inability of the Federal and state Government to meet its demands.Dr Sokomba stated that the members that are attending to Covid-19 patients at designated isolation centres are exempted.  Our Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that the president expressed concerns for eight hundred doctors that have been exposed to Covid -19 pandemic and the two hundred doctors who tested positive, including ten doctors who have died of the Covid -19 pandemic.  Recall that the organisation had threatened the strike over series of issues, including the "grossly inadequate" provision of protective equipment, calls for hazard pay for those working on virus-affected patients. Other demands focused on improving general welfare and protest against sackings or pay cuts for doctors in some states.
