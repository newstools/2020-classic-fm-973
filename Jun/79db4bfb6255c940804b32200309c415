President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated Evariste Ndayishimiye on taking office as President of Burundi after a swearing-in ceremony on Thursday in the political capital, Gitega.  The President also felicitates with the Government and people of Burundi on the historic peaceful transition to a democratically elected government, after the sudden demise of President Pierre Nkurunziza.  With a resounding victory at the polls, the Nigerian leader believes that President Ndayishimiye, who had served as Secretary-General of the ruling CNDD-FDD party, and played an active role in guiding the country on the path of peace and development, has what it takes to consolidate democracy in the east African country.  President Buhari looks forward to working with the new Burundian leader and his government to strengthen the warm relationship between the two countries.
