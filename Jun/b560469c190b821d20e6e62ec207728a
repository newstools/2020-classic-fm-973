The National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has reaffirmed its decisions on the results of the screening of governorship aspirants for Edo last week noting that the 3 successfully screened will contest at the primaries slated for the 22nd of June.  National Chairman of the APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, briefing State House Correspondents after the NWC’s meeting with the Chief of Staff to the President, Professor Ibrahim Gambari, in Abuja said the APC Governorship screening exercise which disqualified Governor Obaseki was thoroughly done to avert future incidences like that of Bayelsa.  Comrade Oshiomole also allayed fears that the party might lose Edo to the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) if Governor Godwin Obaseki, decamps and eventually gets its governorship ticket.
