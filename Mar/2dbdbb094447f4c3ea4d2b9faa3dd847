The Lagos State Government has disclosed that four new persons have tested positive to the deadly Coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the state to eleven. This means that the over twelve people have been infected with the deadly disease in the country.  Lagos Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi disclosed this on Thursday, saying that the government was currently following up over 1,300 contact cases. Abayomi disclosed that nineteen people were tested for Coronavirus on Wednesday in Lagos and that four out of them had tested positive to the virus and had been isolated for treatment at the Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba area of Lagos, Southwest Nigeria.  He said the first of the four new cases who tested positive to the disease was a woman who had contact with another female who came fromÂ  the UK some days ago who was tested positive.  According to him, the second new case was a female who returned from France on the 14th of March on a Turkish airline TK 1830. The third case, he said, was a Nigerian male in his 50s who had not travelled anywhere, but tested positive to the disease.

The commissioner, however, said more tests were still being carried out, saying that it was clear that there are a combination of imported cases and local transmission.
