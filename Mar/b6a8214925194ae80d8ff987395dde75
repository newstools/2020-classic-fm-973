The National Leader of the All Progressive Congress, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has advised all residents of Lagos and Nigerians in general to obey government directives and measures put in place to curtail the spread of Coronavirus.  Addressing newsmen at the Lagos House Marina after meeting with Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu behind closed doors with some other top members of the APC, Tinubu who said he was in support of any decision taken by the government, including a total lockdown if necessary, to halt the spread of the virus, encouraged Nigerians to do the same.  So far, Lagos has the highest number of confirmed Coronavirus cases in the country. The State Government has since implemented some measures, including social distancing and directing a category of its workers to work from home. Our Correspondent Immanuel Odeyemi reports that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu is now meeting with some members of his cabinet and other key stakeholders on the next step to take to halt the spread of Covid-19.
