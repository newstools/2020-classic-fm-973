Clifford “T.I.” Harris and Killer Mike donned masks and gloves to serve over 500 meals to families affected by COVID-19 on Wednesday (May 6). The two Hip Hop heavyweights adhering to the CDC safety guidelines posted up outside of Bankhead Seafood Market, which Tip and the Run The Jewels MC bought in 2018 after it closed down.  Mike, who grew up eating there as a kid, told GPB News how much that area of town meant to him and why he decided to step up. “T.I. and I went in and bought a business and wanted to keep it going,” he explained. “And in the middle of that, a pandemic happened. So, whether money is being made the priority is human beings and people. People need to eat.”  Along with the Atlanta nonprofit organization PAWkids, Mike and Tip have committed to distributing 1,000 meals each week to families in need in the area. Wednesday was the kick off for the recently established partnership. Throughout the afternoon, volunteers handed out brown bags of food and household items. PAWkids founder and director Latonya Johnston joined Mike as he passed out the bags, saying, “There is so much love here and we’re in this together. It’s time to get out, get busy, and take care of your people.”  T.I. and Mike are among the growing number of Hip Hop artists who are stepping up in these unprecedented times.
