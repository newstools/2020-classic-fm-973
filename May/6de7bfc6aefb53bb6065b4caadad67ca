President Muhammadu Buhari has cancelled this year’s Sallah homage to him by the Muslim faithful at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.  This was contained in a statement issued by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu in Abuja Friday. The President also announced that he alongside his family members would be observing the Eid prayers at home.  The decision, he explained was in obedience to the directive of the Sultan of Sokoto and President General of the Jama’atu Nasril Islam (JNI), Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar III suspending Eid congregational prayers across the country and in compliance with the protocol against mass gathering issued by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19.
