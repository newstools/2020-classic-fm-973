An expert has said that research as to how voters use debates to make an informed decision about who to vote for in US elections has shown some positives. National and international expert on presidential debates, and Professor of Communications at the University of Missouri; Professor Mitchell McKinney made this disclosure in his comments during a virtual briefing of selected journalists covering the US elections remotely from different countries all over the world.  Professor McKinney, among many other achievements, has advised the US Commission on Presidential Debates where his work was instrumental in developing the presidential town hall debate format, said it has become very apparent that debate moments after long and grueling campaigns seem to be about the only time that party candidates stand side by side on the debate stage, and research has substantiated that voters really value that opportunity to compare the candidates.  He was also of the opinion that expectedly, everybody across all divides expect to hear from the candidates definite plans and projections and voters tend to think of those moments as a useful and credible form of campaign communication, as opposed to the candidates ads, as opposed to the candidates controlled conventional addresses, their regular speeches, and even their media appearances on often partisan media or those media networks sympathetic to their cause.  Professor McKinney however pointed out that while there is no election law making participation in election debates mandatory; it has over time become a tradition since 1976. He noted that it is on record that sometimes candidates have refused. Professor McKinney recalled that Jimmy Carter refused until just nine days before his election with Ronald Reagan who turned in a very strong debate performance and went on to win in a landslide.  He spoke about how election debates have become very key to the electoral participation in America quoting the memorable Joe Biden's historical vice-presidential debate, and the last round of 2016 presidential debates, which broke records, clocking the highest viewership with about 81 million viewers for that first debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. - Story by Immanuel Odeyemi
