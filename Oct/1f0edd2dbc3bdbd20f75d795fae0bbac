As the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) prepares to conduct the Ondo Governorship Election on Saturday, October 10, 2020, the INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu has urged its staff to resist any form of temptation and be guided by the extant laws and good conscience.  Prof. Yakubu who gave the charge in a message to INEC personnel today, further stated that although Nigerians and friends of Nigeria are pleased with the outcome of the recent Edo Governorship Election, and INEC is encouraged by their commendations, the Commission cannot afford to rest on its oars.  He stressed that INEC personnel must consolidate on the Commissionâ€™s recent achievements and account for every single vote cast on 10th October in a transparent manner that will ensure that only the choice of the electorate prevail.
