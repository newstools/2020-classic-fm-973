In continuation of efforts to stamp out armed banditry in the country, the Air Task Force of Operation Lafiya Dole has neutralized several Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) elements and destroyed their hideouts at Tudun Wulgo and Tumbun Gini on the fringes of Lake Chad in Borno State.  The Coordinator Defense Media Operations Maj. Gen. John Enenche in a statement revealed that the feat was achieved through air strikes executed yesterday, 15 October 2020, as part of a new subsidiary Operation, tagged “Wukar Tabki”, after series of aerial surveillance missions had indicated that the 2 locations, with structures and logistics items camouflaged under the dense vegetation, were being used as staging areas where some ISWAP leaders and their fighters meet to plan and launch attacks.  Accordingly, the Air Task Force dispatched a force package of Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter jets and helicopter gunships to engage the 2 locations. The attack aircraft scored devastating hits in the target areas, destroying some structures and neutralizing several of the terrorists.
