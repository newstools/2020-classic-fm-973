In a statement in Abuja, the NNPC further stated that general administrative expenses also dipped by 22 per cent from N894 billion in 2018 to N696 billion in 2019.  Presenting the report, Chief Financial Officer, CFO, of the NNPC, Mr. Umar Ajiya, explained that the improved performance in the 2019 financial year was driven mainly by cost optimization, contracts renegotiation and operational efficiency.

He explained that the 2019 audited financial statement goes further to demonstrate the NNPC’s unwavering commitment to the principle of Transparency, Accountability and Performance Excellence, TAPE. He noted that the 2019 Audited Financial Statement, which was concluded five months after the release of the 2018 Audited Financial Statement, would be published on the NNPC’s website for all to see in keeping with the management’s commitment to transparency and accountability and in consonance with the principles of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) of which it is a partner.
