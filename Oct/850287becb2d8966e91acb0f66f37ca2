The Nigerian Senate has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to urgently address the nation on the #EndSARS protest which has taken a violent dimension.  Members of the Upper Legislative Chamber also implored the protesters to stop their demonstrations and embrace genuine dialogue to address the issues raised, following resolutions reached at today's plenary after a short debate on a motion sponsored by Senator Biodun Olujimi on the disturbing security trends and the need for a comprehensive reform.  Contributing to the motion, Deputy President of the Senate, Ovie Omo-Agege noted that most of the demands of the #EndSARS protesters are Constitutional issues which the President cannot immediately address while Minority Leader of the Senate, Enyinnanya Abaribe, stressed that a presidential address will calm the nerves of Nigerians.  Our Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that the Senate while appealing to Nigerians to resort to use of legal and institutional channels of resolving conflicts and disputes, urged the police and other security agencies to operate strictly in accordance with the rules of engagement appropriate to a democratic environment.
