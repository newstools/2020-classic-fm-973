The Department of State Services DSS has debunked the news that it is aiding attacks on the #ENDSARS protesters. In a statement made available to newsmen by its Public Relations Officer Dr. Peter Afunnaya,the Service said it is a responsible professional Organization and will endeavor to remain so at all times. It said the allegations leveled against it are not true and can only be taken as false narratives designed to cast it in bad image as well as inflame the protests. The DSS enjoined the public to disregard the falsehood emanating from sections of the social and mainstream media, subversive groups and interests while calling on citizens to eschew bitterness, remain law abiding and cooperate with security agencies and indeed, the Government for lasting peace and public safety.
