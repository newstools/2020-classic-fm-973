The American democratic election process has been described as a model which should be a reference point for any country seeking to ensure checks and balances in order to control abuse of power across levels of governance. This was the submission by an expert on the US federal government system, the Presidency, politics and elections; Dr. Mark J. Rozell during a virtual briefing organized for journalists from all over the world to enable them cover the US Presidential Elections remotely.  Dr. Rozell during the briefing which was the first in a two-month long series, focusing on an introduction to the US electoral system, explained to journalists that the American system which is the outcome of an 18th century constitution was effectively structured to divide and fracture power in many different directions in order to ensure that no one group holds all the power in the United States.  Speaking further, Dr. Rozell gave historical reasons for the birth of the system saying that there was originally a very deep distrust at that time of central government authority in America considering that it had been under the British monarchy and also fought a war, therefore the founding fathers of the American Republic did not want a strongly centralized authority, thereby choosing instead to give a great amount of independent power to the sub national units.  While fielding questions from the journalists, Dr. Rozell explained with the Electoral College system, poll results giving advantage to a particular candidate may not be a true reflection of who wins the election, but rather, how much effort each candidate puts into securing votes in the swing states.  Our Correspondent Immanuel Odeyemi reports that two hundred and twenty-five top journalists from all over the world have been selected to cover the 2020 US Presidential Election remotely.
