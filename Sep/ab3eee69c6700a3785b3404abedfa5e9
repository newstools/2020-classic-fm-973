The Federal Government has again expressed its readiness to provide support to the print subsector of the media industry, noting that government is waiting for the the Newspapers Proprietors Association of Nigeria (NPAN) to come forward with a submission on how government can help to mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 on the industry.  Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who disclosed this to State House Correspondents today after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari in the Aso Villa, Abuja, said government has already intervened in some ways in the broadcast subsector of the industry.  Our Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that the Minister who was at the Presidential Villa to make a presentation of a portrait of the Argungu Festival to Mr President, also noted that the federal government is serious about developing the entire creative industry, especially because of the huge job opportunity potential in the industry.
