The Federal Government has appealed to the Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) to suspend its nationwide strike.  The Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire who made the appeal during a briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 in Abuja, noted that the call is necessary in view of the pandemic and asked the striking workers to sheathe their sword and come to the negotiation table.  The ministerâ€™s plea comes hours after JOHESU President, Dr. Biobelomoye Josiah, asked the federal government to attend to its demands with the same seriousness as attached to those of the National Association of Resident Doctors.
